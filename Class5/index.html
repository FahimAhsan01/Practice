    <h3 class="titles">CSS:</h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>


    <h3 class="titles">Types of CSS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline CSS:
            <p>Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. It is applied using the style attribute of the HTML tag. For example:</p>
            <pre>
                &lt;h3 style="color: red; text-align:center"&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h3&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Internal CSS:
            <p>Internal CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML page. It is applied using the style tag in the head section of the HTML page. For example:</p>
            <pre>
                &lt;style&gt;
                    h3 {
                                    color: red;
                    }
                &lt;/style&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>External CSS:
            <p>External CSS is used to apply a unique style to multiple HTML pages. This is the most preferred and commonly used method for applying CSS to html. It is applied using a separate CSS file. The external CSS file is linked to the html file using the following statement.</p>
            <pre>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="titles">Selectors, Properties and Values in CSS:</h3>
    <p>Selector: A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like h1, h2, div etc.</p>
    <p>Properties: Properties are the styles that you can apply to the selector. For example, color, font-size, background-color etc.</p>
    <p>Values: Values are the assigned values to the properties. For example, if the property is color, the value could be red, green, blue etc.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>Let's say we want to change the color of all the h1 tags to red. The CSS code for this would be:</p>
    <pre>
        h1 {
                        color: red;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>Here, h1 is the selector, color is the property and red is the value.</p>
    <p>There are 3 kinds of selectors and each one of them have their own calls. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Element Selector</li>
        <li>Class Selector</li>
        <li>ID Selector</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Element Selector: This selects all the elements of a particular type. For example, if we want to select all the h1 tags, the selector would be</p><div>h1</div>
    <p>Class Selector: This selects all the elements with a particular class. For example, if we want to select all the elements with the class name "heading", the selector would be</p><div>.heading</div>
    <p>ID Selector: This selects a single element with a particular ID. For example, if we want to select the element with the ID "main-heading", the selector would be </p><div>#main-heading</div>
    <p>The ID selector has the highest priority, followed by the Class selector and finally the Element Selector. If a single selector is affected by multiple properties and values, then the value at the last of the list will be the one that will remain active.<br>
    Only a single ID selector can be used per element but there is no limit to the number of Class selectors. So, multiple Class selectors can be used for a single element to carry over previous CSS styles and customize a new one.</p>

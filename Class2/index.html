        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <h2>I'm Fahim Ahsan</h2>
        <p>This is my first static webpage</p>
        <p>What I've learnt today:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML Syntax</li>
            <li>HTML Components</li>
            <li>HTML Tags, which are of 2 kinds:
                <ul>
                    <li>Block type tags</li>
                    <li>Inline Block type tags</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How to set the type and start attributes of an ordered list. For example:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>First</li>
                    <li>Second</li>
                </ol>
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>Roman First</li>
                    <li>Roman Second</li>
                </ol>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li>Third</li>
                    <li>Fourth</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Ordered and Unordered Lists</li>
            <li>Adding images to the page with "img" tag</li>
            <li>Adding links to the page with "a" tag</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here's an image from an upcoming game:</p><br>
        <img src="./Images/monster_hunter_wilds.jpg" width="400" height="250">
        <p>But the image was too big so I had to customize it to a fixed width and height of 400px and 250px respectively.</p>
        <p>Here's a link to the game's official website incase you are interested:</p>
        <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>
        <p>Please note that without using the "target="_blank"" attribute, the anchor tag opens the href link in the current tab instead of a new tab.</p>
        <p>Also, we were suggested to use "Pixabay" for images as images downloaded from here retain their resolution.</p>
        <p>That's all for today. I plan to document each of my classes just like today. Hoping for the best.</p>
